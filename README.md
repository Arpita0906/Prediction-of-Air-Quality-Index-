Title: Prediction of Air Quality Index Using Machine Learning Techniques: A Comparative Analysis

In this project, we aimed to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) using various machine learning techniques, presenting a comparative analysis of their performance. The motivation stems from the critical impact of air quality on public health and the environment. Our objectives include developing predictive models, evaluating their effectiveness, and identifying the most reliable model.

Utilizing a carefully curated dataset, we explored machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Logistic regression, KNN,Decision Tree regressor, lesso. Data preprocessing involved handling missing values, feature scaling, and proper data splitting for training and testing.we have used SMOTE for balancing our dataset to avoid imbalance.
The conclusion summarizes our findings, shedding light on the implications for predicting AQI. Future work is outlined, suggesting avenues for improvement, such as incorporating additional features and exploring real-time AQI prediction.

This project underscores the intersection of environmental science and machine learning, showcasing the potential for data-driven insights to address pressing issues like air quality.
